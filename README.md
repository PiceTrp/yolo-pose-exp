## Project Overview

This project implements a pose estimation pipeline using the YOLO architecture. It leverages DVC for tracking datasets and pipeline stages, ensuring that experiments are reproducible and data is versioned effectively.

## Features

- **YOLO-based Pose Estimation**: Utilizes the YOLO model for detecting and estimating poses in images.
- **DVC Integration**: Tracks datasets and pipeline stages, enabling easy version control and reproducibility.
- **Modular Pipeline**: Easily extendable and customizable for different datasets and configurations.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Initialize DVC**:
   ```bash
   dvc init
   ```

4. **Pull the data** (if data is tracked remotely):
   ```bash
   dvc pull
   ```

## Usage

To run the pose estimation pipeline, execute the following command:

```bash
python run_pipeline.py
```

### Running Experiments

You can modify the configuration files in the `configs/` directory to change model parameters, dataset paths, and other settings.

## Data Management with DVC

This project uses DVC to manage datasets and pipeline stages. Here are some common DVC commands you might find useful:

- **Add data to DVC**:
  ```bash
  dvc add data/your-dataset
  ```

- **Commit changes**:
  ```bash
  dvc commit
  ```

- **Push data to remote storage**:
  ```bash
  dvc push
  ```

- **Pull data from remote storage**:
  ```bash
  dvc pull
  ```
